## GifTastic Game
     This web application is divided into three component: 
    * Buttons display
    * User form input 
    * Images display
    When the page is first loaded, the application comes with three buttons with animal names on them. The user can add as more as he/she likes by just entering the animal name and hit the submit button. Then, the new button will be appended to the buttons list.  
    If the user presses any buttons on that list, ten gifs will be shown just right below, in a still mode. Now, the user can click any picture to see the animated mode. That is fun and easy to use app!!!
